1.5.0
=====
:release-date: 2016-10-20 11:08 A.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- New API for :class:`~thorn.ModelEvent`.

    After having used Thorn for a while, there was a realization
    that passing lots of arguments to a decorator looks very messy
    when there are many events for a model.

    We have come up with a new way to add webhooks to models,
    that we believe is more tidy.

    The new API moves declaration of webhooks related things into a
    nested class:

    .. code-block:: python

        @webhook_model
        class Article(models.Model):
            uuid = models.UUIDField()
            title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
            state = models.CharField(max_length=128, default='PENDING')
            body = models.TextField()
            user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)

            class webhooks:
                on_create = ModelEvent('article.created')
                on_change = ModelEvent('article.changed')
                on_delete = ModelEvent('article.removed')
                on_publish = ModelEvent(
                    'article.published', state__now_eq='PUBLISHED',
                ).dispatches_on_change()

                def payload(self, article):
                    return {
                        'title': article.title,
                    }

                def headers(self, article):
                    return {
                        'Authorization':
                            'Bearer {}'.format(article.user.access_token),
                    }

    .. note::

        The old API is still supported, and there's no current plans
        of deprecating the arguments to the decorator itself.

- Adds support for buffering events - moving dispatch out of signal handlers.

    See :ref:`event-buffering` for more information.

- Models can now define additional headers to be passed on to webhooks.

    See :ref:`events-model-header`.

    Contributed by **Flavio Curella**.

- Django: :class:`~thorn.ModelEvent` now takes advantage of
  ``Model.get_absolute_url()``.

    Instead of defining a reverser you can now simply have your model
    define a ``get_absolute_url`` method (which is a convention already):

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.urls import reverse

        class Article(models.Model):

            def get_absolute_url(self):
                return reverse('article:detail', kwargs={'slug': self.slug})

    For more information on defining this method, refer to the
    Django documentation:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/instances/#get-absolute-url

- New :setting:`THORN_SIGNAL_HONORS_TRANSACTION` setting.

    If enabled the Django model events will dispatch only after
    the transaction is committed, and should the transaction be rolled back
    the events are discarded.

    You can also enable this setting on individual events:

    .. code-block:: python

        ModelEvent(..., signal_honors_transaction=True)

    Disabled by default.

    To be enabled by default in Thorn 2.0.

- :class:`~thorn.ModelEvent` now logs errors instead of propagating them.

    ``ModelEvent(propagate_errors=True)`` may be set to revert to the old
    behavior.

- URLs now ordered by scheme,host,port (was host,port,scheme).

.. _version-1.4.2:

1.4.2
=====
:release-date: 2016-07-28 11:45 A.M PDT

- Serialize uuid as string when calling Celery tasks.

.. _version-1.4.1:

1.4.1
=====
:release-date: 2016-07-26 01:06 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Fixed webhook dispatch crash where validator was deserialized twice.

- Celery dispatcher did not properly forward the `Hook-Subscription`
  HTTP header.

- Source code now using Google-style docstrings.

.. _version-1.4.0:

1.4.0
=====
:release-date: 2016-07-11 04:27 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- New HTTP header now sent with events: ``Hook-Subscription``

    This contains the UUID of the subscription, which means
    a webhook consumer may now react by cancelling or modifying the subscription.

- Fixed missing default value for the :setting:`THORN_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL`
  setting.

- Fixed HMAC signing wrong message value.

.. _version-1.3.0:

1.3.0
=====
:release-date: 2016-07-07 07:40 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- New and improved method for HMAC signing.

    The new method must be enabled manually by setting:

    .. code-block:: python

        THORN_HMAC_SIGNER = 'thorn.utils.hmac:sign'

    It turns out itsdangerous did not do what we expected it to,
    instead it does this:

    - The secret key is transformed into:

        .. code-block:: python

            key = hashlib.sha256(salt + 'signer' + HMAC_SECRET)
           # strip = from beginning and end of the base64 string
           key = key.strip('=')

    - If you don’t specify a salt, which we don’t, there is a
      default salt(!) which is:

      .. code-block:: text

        “itsdangerous.Signer”

    - The extra "signer" in the key transformation is there as the default
      key_derivation method is called “django-concat”.

    - The final signature is encoded using “urlsafe_b64encode"

        So in Python to recreate the signature using the built-in hmac
        library you would have to do:

        .. code-block:: python

            import hashlib
            import hmac
            from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

            # everything hardcoded to SHA256 here

            def create_signature(secret_key, message):
                key = hashlib.sha256(
                    'itsdangerous.Signer' + 'signer' + secret_key).digest()
                digest = hmac.new(key, message, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
                return urlsafe_b64encode(digest).replace('=')

        which is much more complicated than what we can expect of users.

    You're highly encouraged to enable the new HMAC method, but sadly
    it's not backwards compatible.

    We have also included new examples for verifying HMAC signatures
    in Django, Ruby, and PHP in the documentation.

- New :setting:`THORN_SUBSCRIBER_MODEL` setting.

- New :setting:`THORN_HMAC_SIGNER` setting.

- Requirements: Tests now depends on :pypi:`case` 1.2.2

- JSON: Make sure simplejson does not convert :class:`~decimal.Decimal`
  to :class:`float`.

- class:`~thorn.events.ModelEvent`: name can now be a string format.

    Contributed by Flavio Curella.

    The format expands using the model instance affected, e.g:

    .. code-block:: python

        on_created=ModelEvent('created.{.occasion}')

    means the format will expand into ``instance.occasion``.

    Subclasses of :class:`~thorn.events.ModelEvent` can override how the name is
    expanded by defining the ``_get_name`` method.

.. _version-1.2.1:

1.2.1
=====
:release-date: 2016-06-06 06:30 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Celery: Forward event signal context to the tasks.

.. _version-1.2.0:

1.2.0
=====
:release-date: 2016-06-02 01:00 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Event: Adds ``request_data`` option.

    This enables you to inject additional data into the webhook payload,
    used for integration with quirky HTTP endpoints.

- Event: Adds ``allow_keepalive`` option.

    HTTP connections will not be reused for an event if this flag is set to
    False.  Keepalive is enabled by default.

- Event: Adds ``subscribers`` argument that can be used to add
  default subscribers for the event.

    This argument can hold the same values as the :setting:`THORN_SUBSCRIBERS`
    setting.

- Decorator: ``model.webhook_events`` is now a UserDict proxy
    to ``model.webhook_events.events``.

- Subscriber: :class:`thorn.generic.models.AbstractSubscribers` is a
  new abstract interface for subscriber models.

    This should be used if you want to check if an object is a subscriber
    in :func:`isinstance` checks.

- Q: ``now__*`` operators now properly handles the case when there's
     no previous version of the object.

- Django: :data:`django.db.models.signals.pre_save` signal handler
  now ignores :exc:`~Adjango.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist` errors.

- Events: Adds new ``prepare_recipient_validators`` method, enabling
  subclasses to e.g. set default validators.

- Windows: Unit test suite now passing on win32/win64.

- Module ``thorn.models`` renamed to :mod:`thorn.generic.models`.

.. _version-1.1.0:

1.1.0
=====
:release-date: 2016-05-23 12:00 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Fixed installation on Python 3

    Fix contributed by Josh Drake.

- Now depends on

    - :pypi:`itsdangerous`

    - :pypi:`ipaddress` (Python 2.7)

- Security: Now provides HMAC signing by default.

    The Subscriber model has a new ``hmac_secret`` field
    which subscribers can provide to set the secret key for
    communication.  A default secret will be created if none is provided,
    and can be found in the response of the subscribe endpoint.

    The signed HMAC message found in the ``Hook-HMAC`` HTTP header
    can then be used to verify the sender of the webhook.

    An example Django webhook consumer verifying the signature
    can be found in the :ref:`Django guide <django-example-consumer>`.

    Thanks to Timothy Fitz for suggestions.

- Security: No longer dispatches webhooks to internal networks.

    This means Thorn will refuse to deliver webhooks to
    networks considered internal, like ``fd00::/8``, ``10.0.0.0/8``,
    ``172.16.0.0/12``, ``192.168.0.0/16`` and ``127.0.0.1``

    This behavior can be changed globally using the
    :setting:`THORN_RECIPIENT_VALIDATORS` setting, or on an per-event basis
    using the ``recipient_validators`` argument to :class:`~Thorn.event`.

- Security: Now only dispatches to HTTP and HTTPS URLs by default.

    This behavior can be changed globally using the
    :setting:`THORN_RECIPIENT_VALIDATORS` setting, or on an per-event basis
    using the ``recipient_validators`` argument to :class:`~Thorn.event`.

- Security: Now only dispatches to ports 80 and 443 by default.

    This behavior can be changed globally using the
    :setting:`THORN_RECIPIENT_VALIDATORS` setting, or on an per-event basis
    using the ``recipient_validators`` argument to :class:`~Thorn.event`.

- Security: Adds recipient validators

    You can now validate the recipient URL by providing a list
    of validators in the ``recipient_validators`` argument to
    :class:`~thorn.Event`.

    The default list of validators is provided by the
    new :setting:`THORN_RECIPIENT_VALIDATORS` setting.

    Thanks to Edmond Wong for reviewing, and Timothy Fitz for suggestions.

- Django: Now properly supports custom user models by using
  ``UserModel.get_username()``.

    Fix contributed by Josh Drake.

- ModelEvent: Adds new many-to-many signal dispatcher types

    - ``dispatches_on_m2m_add(related_field)``

        Sent when a new object is added to a many-to-many relation.

    - ``dispatches_on_m2m_remove(related_field)``

        Sent when an object is removed from a many-to-many relation.

    - ``dispatches_on_m2m_clear(related_field)``

        Sent when a many-to-many relation is cleared.

    **Example**

    In this blog article model, events are sent whenever a new
    tag is added or removed:

    .. code-block:: python

        @webhook_model(
            on_add_tag=ModelEvent(
                'article.tagged').dispatches_on_m2m_add('tags'),
            on_remove_tag=ModelEvent(
                'article.untagged').dispatches_on_m2m_remove('tags'),
            on_clear_tags=ModelEvent(
                'article.tags_cleared').dispatches_on_m2m_clear('tags'),
        )
        class Article(models.Model):
            title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
            tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag)


        class Tag(models.Model):
            name = models.CharField(max_length=64, unique=True)

    The ``article.tagged`` webhook is sent when::

        >>> python_tag, _ = Tag.objects.get_or_create(name='python')
        >>> article.tags.add(python_tag)  # <-- dispatches with this line

    and the ``article.untagged`` webhook is sent when::

        >>> article.tags.remove(python_tag)

    finally, the ``article.tags_cleared`` event is sent when::

        >>> article.tags.clear()
